Thanks for visiting my website.

I've been working in the IT industry for more than 10 years, I'm currently acting in a System Administrator role providing day to day Windows Servers infrastructure and application support. I first heard about PowerShell back in 2014 and since then have used it to support my day to day tasks, I have an increasing interest in coding and creating solutions to automate my daily tasks. I'm by no means an expert but have a reasonable understanding of the PowerShell language and I'm constantly learning new ways to utilise it effectively. In my current role I generally work from the console and I'm always looking at ways to utilise PowerShell to remove the repetitive tedious aspects of my work.

My understanding of PowerShell has been significantly impacted by the books written by Don Jones and Jeff Hicks, such as PowerShell in a Month of Lunchs, PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches both of which are available from Manning books. I base the creation of my PowerShell modules based on the above books and the Creating Modules book by Brandon Olin which you can find on Leanpub, this is an agile book that unfortunately doesn't appear will ever be completed but what has been published is still useful.

In 2021 I completed my bachelor degree in Information Technology with a specialisation of business analysis and minor of server administration. At the time that I started my degree the organisation I worked with was committed to outsourcing all IT functions to reduce costs. This only lasted a couple of years before the decision was made to bring some of the services back in house. In 2020 I rediscovered Linux while completing a server administration subject which focussed on Linux. Initially I was running the Ubuntu based Linux distro Pop!_OS on an old Apple Mac Mini. Given some limitations with using a window manager on this base I moved to a basic Debian install, before ultimately setting on Arch. I used Arch for nearly two years, before moving to my current distriubtion Void Linux I'm happy using this distribution but am considering giving NixOS a try also.

The purpose of this site is to capture and document the things I've learned and share them with those who stumble across this site. My aim is to produce content that is clear and easy to understand and that aligns with PowerShell best practices.

### Looking Ahead in 2024
I plan to finally commit to learn how to use the Pester framework to complete unit testing of my code, this will be one of my primary focuses during 2024. Another focus will be the use of Ansible to configure my Windows test environment and automate the provisioning of my test environment using Vagrant. Finally I also want to complete a first instance of a build pipeline for my modules using Plaster, Platyps and PSBuild.

Thanks for reading, Craig
